1. Estimates indicate that the aquifer contains enough water to fill Lake Huron, but unfortunately, under the semiarid climatic conditions that presently exist in the region, rates of addition to the aquifer are minimal, amounting to about half a centimeter a year.
评估指出畜水层含有足够填满休伦湖的水分，然而不幸的是，在这个地区的半干旱的气候情况的影响下，蓄水层增加的比率是少的，总计大概每年半厘米。
2. This unprecedented development of a finite groundwater resource with an almost negligible natural recharge rate—that is, virtually no natural water source to replenish the water supply—has caused water tables in the region to fall drastically.
水资源的自然增长几乎是微乎其微的——就是说，事实上没有去补充水供应的自然水资源——这次对于有限的水资源的空前的开采，导致了这个地区的水平面剧烈地下降。
3. The incentive of the farmers who wish to conserve water is reduced by their knowledge that many of their neighbors are profiting by using great amounts of water, and in the process are drawing down the entire region’s water supplies.
农夫们想要储水的动机减少了，随着他们知道许多他们的邻居大量用水并从拉低整个地区的水资源供应中获利。
4. Unfortunately, the cost of water obtained through any of these schemes would increase pumping costs at least tenfold, making the cost of irrigated agricultural products from the region uncompetitive on the national and international markets.
不幸的是，从任何这些计划中得到的水费将会最低十倍地增长水泵的花费，导致灌溉农作物的花费升高，从而在全国和国际市场上失去竞争力
5. Whatever the final answer to the water crisis may be, it is evident that within the High Plains, irrigation water will never again be the abundant, inexpensive resource it was during the agricultural boom years of the mid-twentieth century.
无论水资源危机的最终答案是什么，经过二十世纪中期的农业爆炸，包括高原在内，灌溉用水将不再是充足而廉价的资源是显而易见的。
