1. The onrushing water arising from these flash floods likely also formed the odd teardrop-shaped ¡°islands¡± (resembling the miniature versions seen in the wet sand of our beaches at low tide) that have been found on the plains close to the ends of the outflow channels.

2. Judging from the width and depth of the channels, the flow rates must have been truly enormous¡ªperhaps as much as a hundred times greater than the 105 tons per second carried by the great Amazon river.
3. A 2003 Mars Global Surveyor image shows what mission specialists think may be a delta¡ªa fan-shaped network of channels and sediments where a river once flowed into a larger body of water, in this case a lake filling a crater in the southern highlands.

4. But detractors maintain that the terraces could also have been created by geological activity, perhaps related to the geologic forces that depressed the Northern Hemisphere far below the level of the south, in which case they have nothing whatever to do with Martian water.

5. Furthermore, Mars Global Surveyor data released in 2003 seem to indicate that the Martian surface contains too few carbonate rock layers¡ªlayers containing compounds of carbon and oxygen¡ªthat should have been formed in abundance in an ancient ocean.

6. Aside from some small-scale gullies (channels) found since 2000, which are inconclusive, astronomers have no direct evidence for liquid water anywhere on the surface of Mars today, and the amount of water vapor in the Martian atmosphere is tiny.
