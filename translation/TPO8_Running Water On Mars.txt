1. The onrushing water arising from these flash floods likely also formed the odd teardrop-shaped “islands” (resembling the miniature versions seen in the wet sand of our beaches at low tide) that have been found on the plains close to the ends of the outflow channels.
这从火速的洪流中形成的凶猛的水流看起来也形成了这些在临近外流渠末端的平原上被发现的奇葩的泪滴形状的“岛屿”（就像低潮时在沙滩上被发现的干沙土的缩略版）。
2. Judging from the width and depth of the channels, the flow rates must have been truly enormous―perhaps as much as a hundred times greater than the 105 tons per second carried by the great Amazon river.
由这些水渠的宽度和深度判断出，流量一定很大――大概差不多比秒流量105吨的亚马孙河的一百倍还要大。
3. A 2003 Mars Global Surveyor image shows what mission specialists think may be a delta―a fan-shaped network of channels and sediments where a river once flowed into a larger body of water, in this case a lake filling a crater in the southern highlands.
一个2003年的火星全球探测图揭示了专家代表们思索的东西大概是一个三角洲――一个扇形的水渠和沉积物网络，在那里一条河流曾经流入一个更大的水体，既然这样，那么一条河流填充了一个在南部高地的火山口。
4. But detractors maintain that the terraces could also have been created by geological activity, perhaps related to the geologic forces that depressed the Northern Hemisphere far below the level of the south, in which case they have nothing whatever to do with Martian water.
然而批评者们仍维护露台可能也是由地质活动创造的观点，也许与压低北半球使其远低于南部水准的地质力量相关，在这种情况下，他们与火星上的水没有任何关系。
5. Furthermore, Mars Global Surveyor data released in 2003 seem to indicate that the Martian surface contains too few carbonate rock layers―layers containing compounds of carbon and oxygen―that should have been formed in abundance in an ancient ocean.
此外，2003年发布的火星全球探测数据似乎指出火星表面含有过少的碳酸盐岩层（含有碳氧复合物的岩层）――这些岩层本应该在原始海洋中被大量形成。
6. Aside from some small-scale gullies (channels) found since 2000, which are inconclusive, astronomers have no direct evidence for liquid water anywhere on the surface of Mars today, and the amount of water vapor in the Martian atmosphere is tiny.
除了一些自从2000年发现的非决定性的小刻度水渠，天文学家们今天仍没有火星表面任何地方的液态水的直接证据，同时火星大气中的水蒸气含量十分稀少。
