1. The extreme seriousness of desertification results from the vast areas of land and the tremendous numbers of people affected, as well as from the great difficulty of reversing or even slowing the process.
沙漠化那极端的严肃性，源自那受影响的土地之广阔、人口之众多，以及去反转，甚至减缓这个过程的艰难之巨大。
2. In areas where considerable soil still remains, though, a rigorously enforced program of land protection and cover-crop planting may make it possible to reverse the present deterioration of the surface.
尽管在一些大量土壤仍然保留的地区，一个严格强制执行的土地保护计划和地表覆盖植物大概仍能使翻转现在的土地退化成为可能。
