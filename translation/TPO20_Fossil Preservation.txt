1. The story of the westward movement of population in the United States is, in the main, the story of the expansion of American agriculture―of the development of new areas for the raising of livestock and the cultivation of wheat, corn, tobacco, and cotton.
总的来讲，美国的西迁运动就是美国农业扩张的故事――家畜的养殖同小麦，玉米，烟草和棉花种植区域的发展与扩张。
2. The European ancestors of some Americans had for centuries lived rooted to the same village or piece of land until some religious, political, or economic crisis uprooted them and drove them across the Atlantic.
一些美国人的欧洲人祖先世世代代居住在同一个村庄或某一片土地，直到一些宗教的、政治的或者经济的危机将他们连根拔起，并驱使他们横渡大西洋。
3. In American society, however, the class structure was less rigid; some people changed occupations easily and believed it was their duty to improve their social and economic position.
然而在美国社会，阶级结构不是很严格。一些人可以很容易地跳槽，同时相信提高他们的社会经济地位是他们的义务。
4. The West had plenty of attractions: the alluvial river bottoms, the fecund soils of the rolling forest lands, the black loams of the prairies were tempting to New England farmers working their rocky, sterile land and to southeastern farmers plagued with soil depletion and erosion.
西部有大量吸引人的东西：冲击湖底、起伏的森林间肥沃的土地、大草原的黑色沃土吸引着耕作在那多石的、贫瘠的土地上的新英格兰农夫们和被土壤耗竭和腐蚀折磨的东南部的农夫们。
